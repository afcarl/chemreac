chremreac is an open source library which aims to collect tools and utilities for
modeling of chemical kinetics problems. It is primarily designed to
be useful in the context of aqueous phase with external radiation fields.

The (heavy) numerical processing is done in rountines written in C++/Fortran which have
been wrapped in a Python interface using Cython.

Documentation
=============

the documentation is hostad at

- http://bjodah.github.io/chemreac/docs/


Installation
============
.. install-start

Easiest way to install chemreac (on linux) is by using 
`conda <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html>`_ to pull it from:
https://binstar.org/bjodah/chemreac


Building from source
--------------------
Below you will find instructions for installation by building chemreac from source.
You may also look in ``scripts/`` folder for automated install scripts used
by the continuous integration servers.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- C++ compiler with C++11 support (e.g. `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ >= 4.8)
- Fortran compiler with ISO_C_BINDING support (Fortran 2003 standard) (e.g. `gfortran <https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/>`_)
- LAPACK (provided by e.g. `OpenBLAS <http://www.openblas.net/>`_)
- `Sundials <http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html>`_ 2.5
- `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ (2.7 or >=3.3)
    
In addition to python, the following python packages are required
(versions indicate what is tested, they are found on 
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and may be installed using ``pip``):

- argh>=0.25.0
- numpy>=1.9.0
- cython>=0.21.0
- mako>=1.0.0
- quantities>=0.10.1
- pytest>=2.5.2
- pytest-pep8>=1.0.6
- scipy>=0.14.0
- matplotlib>=1.4.0
- periodictable>=1.4.1
- future>=0.13.0
- pycompilation>=0.4.0
- pycodeexport>=0.1.0
- sympy>=0.7.6

For rendering the documentation you also need:

- `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
- `numpydoc <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc>`_
- `sphinx_rtd_theme <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_

to run all the tests you also need:

- valgrind
- graphviz
- dot2tex

Building and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once non-python prerequisites are in installed, you may procede e.g. as:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/bjodah/chemreac.git
    $ cd chemreac
    $ pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py install --user
    $ py.test


the above procedure works on Ubuntu 14.04 for example. See the `Python docs <https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html#install-index>`_ for more information on how to install e.g. system wide.

To specify an alternative LAPACK lib, set the environment variable LLAPACK, e.g.:

::

    $ LLAPACK=openblas python setup.py build_ext --inplace


Tests
-----
Run ``py.test``, possibly with explicit ``PYTHONPATH`` (e.g. if ``build_ext --inplace`` was used)

::

    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH py.test --slow --veryslow

All tests should pass (or xfail). If they do not, please `file an issue <https://github.com/bjodah/chemreac/issues>`_.

.. install-end

Status
======


Continuous integration
----------------------
.. ci-start

In order to minimize the risk of (re)introducing bugs into the code
base, it is continuously built on two CI services:

- `travis-ci.org <https://travis-ci.org/bjodah/chemreac>`_
- `drone.io <https://drone.io/github.com/bjodah/chemreac>`_

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/bjodah/chemreac.png?branch=master
   :target: https://travis-ci.org/bjodah/chemreac

above you can find the build status shield for travis-ci (Py 2.7, Py
3.4, no OpenMP, runs coveralls, builds docs and pushes them to the
gh-pages branch).


.. image:: https://drone.io/github.com/bjodah/chemreac/status.png
   :target: https://drone.io/github.com/bjodah/chemreac/latest

above you can find build status shield for drone.io (Py 2.7, uses OpenMP, tests sundials backend, build docs as artifact, html coverage report as artifact):


.. ci-end
