chemreac
========
Chemical Reaction-Diffusion ODE systems discretized in one
dimension. Currently flat, spherical and cylindrical geometries are
implemented. Kinetics are governed by the law of mass action (with the
exception that it is allowed to make a difference between kinetically
active and stoichiometric reactants - e.g. solvent)

The Jacobian matrix can be evaluated and stored in several
formats. (currently dense row-major, dense col-major and banded
formats are supported).

The system of ODE is evaluated in the C++ class chemreac::ReactionDiffusion
(see `src/chemreac_template.cpp`). It is conveniently accessible from Python
(wrapped using Cython). For ease of use, a simple wrapper to
scipy.integrate.ode is provided in `chemreac.integrate.run`.

Setup
=====
```
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/bjodah/chemreac.git
    cd chemreac
    pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    py.test
```

should be enough (tested on Ubuntu 12.04). Add to $PYTHONPATH to use
or ``python setup.py install --user``

To specify an alternative LAPACK lib set the environment variable LLAPACK, e.g.:

```
    LLAPACK=openblas python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

You may also look at ``scrips/test_drone.io.sh`` for the CI install.

Tests
=====
Run py.test
``py.test``
(requires make, python-pytest), eventually source distributions will
include ``runtests.py`` which enables ``python setup.py test`` to work
without having pytest installed.

Prerequisites
=============
In addition to Python packages listed in ``requirements.txt`` you also need:

- C++11 compliant compiler

TODO
======
- Better defined "isolating" boundary conditions for:
    - logx
    - cylindrical/spherical
    - drift
    - and combinations of above.
- Look into logx+lrefl

License
=======
Open Source. Released under the very permissive "simplified
(2-clause) BSD license". See ``LICENSE.txt`` for further details.
