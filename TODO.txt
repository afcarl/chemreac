* remove "banded_padded_jac_cmaj" (same effect can be achieved through
  using and offset plus extra ldj.)

* more tests for logx

* add fixed grid spacing

* stricter boundary conditions:
  - Robin boundary conditions
     - Insulating (enforces no net flux) 
         - Ensure true insulation for spherical/cylindrical (needs careful attention)
     - Explain extrapolating (Polynomial extrapolation)
  Mention that the pure boundary conditions are not useful:
  - Dirichlet
  - Neumann
  - Cauchy

* implement symbolic (PLDU) solver for sundials.

* avoid underflow/(overflow) in logy mode. Convolution?
