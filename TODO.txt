* remove "banded_padded_jac_cmaj" (same effect can be achieved through
  using and offset plus extra ldj.)

* derive finite differences test by hand for geometries starting from
  diffusion equation

* write a separate test to confirm that it correctly handles active case.

* add logx (important in order to keep number of bins to a minimum)

* add fixed grid spacing

* stricter boundary conditions:
  - Robin boundary conditions
     - Insulating (enforces not net flux) - Ensure correct for spherical/cylindrical (might not be!?)
     - Extrapolating (Polynomial extrapolation)
  Mention that the pure boundary conditions are not useful:
  - Dirichlet
  - Neumann
  - Cauchy

* implement symbolic (PLDU) solver for sundials.

* avoid underflow/(overflow) in logy mode. Convolution?
