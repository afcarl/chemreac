chremreac is an open source library which aims to collect tools and utilities for
modeling of chemical kinetics problems. It is primarily designed to
be useful in the context of aqueous phase with external radiation fields.

The (heavy) numerical processing is done in rountines written in C++/Fortran which have
been wrapped in a Python interface using Cython.

Documentation
=============

the documentation is hostad at

- http://chemreac.github.io/docs/index.html


Installation
============
.. install-start

Easiest way to install chemreac (on linux) is by using 
`conda <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html>`_:
::

    $ conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/chemreac chemreac

and you're done! To check if it's installed you may run:

::

    $ python -c "import chemreac"

which should exit silently. If you are not using the conda package
manager you can still install chemreac from source. You will find the
instructions for doing so below.

Building from source
--------------------
Below you will find instructions for installation by building chemreac from source.
You may also look in ``scripts/`` folder for automated install scripts used
on the continuous integration servers.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version numbers of dependencies indicate what has been tested:

- C++ compiler with C++11 support (e.g. `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ >= 4.8)
- Fortran compiler with ISO_C_BINDING support (Fortran 2003 standard) (e.g. `gfortran <https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/>`_)
- LAPACK (provided by e.g. `OpenBLAS <http://www.openblas.net/>`_)
- `Sundials <http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html>`_ 2.5
- `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ (2.7 or >=3.4)
    
In addition to the standard library provided by Python, a number of
python packages are required (see `requirements.txt
<./requirements.txt>`_), they are found on `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and may be installed using ``pip``.

For rendering the documentation you also need:

- `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
- `numpydoc <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc>`_
- `sphinx_rtd_theme <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_

to run all the tests you also need these tools:

- valgrind
- graphviz
- dot2tex

Building and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once non-python prerequisites are in installed, you may procede e.g. as:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/chemreac/chemreac.git
    $ cd chemreac
    $ pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py install --user
    $ ./scripts/run_tests.sh


the above procedure works on Ubuntu 14.04 for example. See the `Python
docs <https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html#install-index>`_
for more information on how to install e.g. system wide.

To specify an alternative LAPACK lib, set the environment variable LLAPACK, e.g.:

::

    $ LLAPACK=openblas python setup.py build_ext --inplace

The following environment variables are also supported by
``setup.py`` (defaults to "0", enable by setting them to "1"):
``WITH_DEBUG``, ``WITH_OPENMP``

Tests
-----
If you have ``py.test`` installed you may run the test suite on the
installed package:

::

    $ py.test --pyargs chemreac

All tests should pass (or xfail). If they do not, please `file an
issue <https://github.com/chemreac/chemreac/issues>`_.

Note that you may need to modify ``$PYTHONPATH``. For example: if you
have only built the package inplace with ``build_ext --inplace``, and
you are standing in the root directory of the repository you may
proceed as:

::

    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH py.test --slow --veryslow

Before submitting a Pull Request you also want to pass ``--pep8`` to
``py.test`` (it is done automatically by the
``./scripts/run_tests.sh`` script but you need ``pytest-pep8`` for it
to work).

.. install-end

Status
======
Both the correctness (continuous integration) and the performance
(benchmarks) of the code base is monitored continuously.

Continuous integration
----------------------
.. ci-start

In order to minimize the risk of (re)introducing bugs into the code
base, it is continuously built on two CI services:

- `travis-ci.org <https://travis-ci.org/chemreac/chemreac>`_
- `drone.io <https://drone.io/github.com/chemreac/chemreac>`_

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/chemreac/chemreac.png?branch=master
   :target: https://travis-ci.org/chemreac/chemreac

Above you can find the build status shield for travis-ci (Py 2.7, Py
3.4, no OpenMP, runs coveralls, builds docs and pushes them to the
chemreac.github.io repo).

.. image:: http://hera.physchem.kth.se:8080/github.com/chemreac/chemreac/status.svg?branch=master
   :target: http://hera.physchem.kth.se:8080/github.com/chemreac/chemreac
   :alt: Build status on hera

Above you can find build status shield for drone on
hera.physchem.kth.se (Py 2.7, uses OpenMP and the Sundials backend,
build docs as artifact, html coverage report as artifact, uses Docker
image from script/docker_drone/Dockerfile)

.. ci-end
