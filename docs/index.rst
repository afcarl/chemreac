Welcome to chemreac's documentation!
====================================

chemreac is an open-source library for modeling chemical kinetcs in either:

- Homogeneous bulk solution
    - Kinetics governed by law of mass action
- Non-homogeneous solution where concentration profile has either:
    - planar symmetry
    - cylindrical symmetry
    - spherical symmetry

For the non-homogeneous case the user may choose:

- reflective or interpolating boundary conditions
- number of stencil points (3, 5 or 7)
- arbitrarily spaced grid
- calculate the electric field from concentrations for advection (drift).

Interfaces are provided to Sundials (CVODE) at the C++ level and to both 
Sundials and ODEPACK at the python level.

Currently the code is written with the following assumptions:

- isothermal conditions

TODO:

- Screening (Debye-HÃ¼ckel)

Advection/Diffusion/Reaction models.
The model is formulated as the Smoluchovski equation and is discretied
in one dimension. The model is implmemnted in a C++ class with Python bindings
for ease of access.
